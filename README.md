# Generative Artistry Overview
For doing generative art things, art with code.
Beginning with some re-implementations from: https://generativeartistry.com/

I also want to try and set these up as phone/computer backgrounds on a schedule, I could do an Action to regen the art, post to the repo, and pull from there on the given device!

# TODO
* [x] Pick one from: https://generativeartistry.com/ to do
* [x] Pick a language to use (Ruby/Rust/Go probably)
* [ ] Setup an Action to run the script and put the image back in the repo (other github storage maybe?)
* [ ] Setup a tasker action to pull it down and set as lock screen on phone
* [ ] Something something for setting it automatically on mac? (cron bash script, if bash can do background)
* [ ] Set background color?
* [ ] Adjust step!
* [ ] Cmdline args for size and output file, then config file with needed outputs
