# Generative Artistry Overview
For doing generative art things, art with code.
Beginning with some re-implementations from: https://generativeartistry.com/

I also want to try and set these up as phone/computer backgrounds on a schedule, I could do an Action to regen the art, post to the repo, and pull from there on the given device!

The random stuff is so weird, even when I set it to UTC NOW I was still getting the exact same random numbers... all good now though.

# TODO
* [ ] Something something for setting it automatically on mac? (cron bash script, if bash can do background)
* [ ] Set background color?
* [ ] Adjust step!
* [ ] config file with various sizes, just pixel right now
* [ ] Tweak script to do the same copy old, gen new for other background possibilities for lines. Do one per type (lines, boxes, etc)
* [x] Pick one from: https://generativeartistry.com/ to do
* [x] Pick a language to use (Ruby/Rust/Go probably)
* [x] Setup an Action to run the script and put the image back in the repo (other github storage maybe?)
* [x] Setup a tasker action to pull it down and set as lock screen on phone
* [x] Cmdline args for size and output file, then config file with needed outputs
